**PROBLEM**

Every hospital, healthcare center, diagnostic center generates a huge amount of data such as patient particulars, test reports, etc which help the doctor to predict patients health condition but it is a troublesome job for the doctors to do this manually. This delay in generation of reports could also lead to fatal incidents. Number of people losing their lives due to heart disease is growing day by day, revealing the need of a model which predicts beforehand. And the expensive treatments and medications are not affordable to everyone and so there is urgency of a structure which can quickly go through the information of the patient and inform the patient if they are likely to suffer from a heart disease in near future and help them take precautions.

**OBJECTIVE**

The main objective of this project is to make a predictive analytics model to diagnose the various stages of heart patients using ensemble learning methods like Bagging, Voting and Boosting which aim to enhance the accuracy of the deficient algorithms. Outcome of these ensemble techniques are then analyzed and the one that proves to enhance the precision of heart disease detection in a patient is considered. Further, with the help of a GUI application the outcome whether a person is affected with heart disease or not is predicted and displayed to the user.

**APPROACH**

Various supervised machine learning algorithms were utilized to predict presence of heart disease, namingly 

Support Vector Machine

Random Forest

Na√Øve Bayes

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

K-Nearest Neighbor 

Based on each of these model results, the model giving the highest accuracy is chosen in ensemble learning to enhance the prediction.
